# File Handling Python Scripts

This repository contains simple Python scripts demonstrating basic file handling operations.

## Scripts Included

### `read_file.py`
- Reads and displays the content of a file named `sample.txt` line by line.
- Handles errors if the file does not exist.

### `file_operations.py`
- Writes user input to a file named `output.txt`.
- Appends additional user input to the same file.
- Displays the final content of the file.
- Includes basic error handling.

## Usage
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Place the scripts in your desired directory.
3. For `read_file.py`, create a `sample.txt` file with some text if needed, then run the script.
4. For `file_operations.py`, run the script and follow the prompts to enter text.

## Notes
- The scripts use basic file I/O operations with try-except blocks for error handling.
- No external dependencies are required.
